# rusty-structures

This project is a playground for building data structures using Rust. The main goal is to have fun and learn more about Rust by implementing and exploring different data structures.

## Purpose
- Practice Rust programming
- Understand how data structures work under the hood
- Experiment with Rust's ownership, borrowing, and memory safety features (specially this one)

## What to Expect
- Simple, educational implementations
- Code focused on learning rather than production use
- Possible future additions of other data structures

Feel free to explore, modify, and use the code for your own learning journey!
